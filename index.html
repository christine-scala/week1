    <p>Rogue, Maverick, and Phoenix are our 3 dogs. Rogue is pretty much a monster, but we love her.  
        Maverick thinks he's a cat.  Pheonix has more energy than any other animal I have ever met.
    Personal space is not a thing with these dogs.  Phoenix and Maverick were both born on Christmas. Also, don't even think about putiing on lotion,
     since they all think it is an invitation to come clean it off you.</p>
